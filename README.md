#How to Code for this Repo
Option A: Fork, Edit, then Pull Request when ready.
Option B: If in San Francisco's Brigade and you have write access to repo: Develop/test in your own branch, preferablly a feature-named-branch, and once it's ready for production, merge into master, which auto deploys to GitHub pages for codeforsanfrancisco.org

Also, it's nice if you merge/commit to gh-pages, that you [let the team know on our Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/forum/#!forum/c4hrva).
